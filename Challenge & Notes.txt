STEP 1) You will need to design and implement a fully functioning application that can 
take these pages and extract meaningful information from the raw source.

The extracted data must contain at least the following fields:

_Title
_Author
_Price
_Shipping Weight
_ISBN-10

Though it is recommended to try to pull out as much data as you can (Bonus points for gathering additional fields).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2) After extracting this information you will need to divide these twenty books into N boxes for shipping 
with each box having no more than ten pounds of books.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3) Your application should ouput its results in a valid and well structured JSON document like the example below:

{
    "box": {
        "id": 1,
        "totalWeight": "1.1 pounds",
        "contents": [
            {
                "title": "The Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow",
                "author": "Cory Doctorow",
                "price": "$9.82 USD",
                "shipping_weight": "1.1 pounds",
                "isbn-10": 1604864044
            }

            . . .
        ]
    }

    . . .
}

NOTES: Process for tackling:
-whats different/same among book pages on amazon?
---want to make sure I'm not building code script that works for one page, but not the others.
